Button functionality needs to be added. Instead of the sum function initiated by input field blur, need the option for a button or link to initiate the sum function.

Possible tags (to be placed on the button or link itself):

datasumtarget = "id of where you want the summed data to appear"
datasum = "ids of elements containing the data to be summed"

Otherwise, for the live function, place the datasum tag on the element designated to contain the summed data.
